name: Multi-line strings
theory: |

  Imagine that we need to define a string that consists of several lines - that is, there are string translations `\n` inside. For example, it would look like this:

  ```python
  text = 'Example of a text,\nconsisting of\nfew lines'
  ```

  The line will look very different in print:

  ```bash
  Example text,
  consisting of
  several lines
  ```

  For such situations Python has another way of creating strings called **multi-line strings**. To describe such a «multi-line string», you need to put it in triple quotes — `"""` or `'''`. Inside the multi-line you can transfer the text and not use a line break `\n`:

  ```python
  text = '''  Example text,
  consisting of
  several lines
  '''
  ```

  ```bash
  Example text,
  consisting of
  several lines

  ```

  Notice that there is a blank line at the end of the text. It appears in the text because we put closing quotes `'''` on a new line. If you don't move the closing quotation marks to a new line, there will be no empty line in the text:

  ```python
  text = '''  Example text,
  consisting of
  several lines'''
  ```

  ```bash
  Example text,
  consisting of
  several lines
  ```

  Because of the triple quotes, multi-line strings allow you not to escape quotes within a string:

  ```bash
  There is no need to escape the 'single' and 'double' quotes
  ```

  Even multi-line strings can become f-string for interpolation:

  ```python
  a = 'A'
  b = 'B'

  # On the left was added f
  text = f'''{a} и {b}
  sitting on a pipe
  '''
  ```

  ```bash
  А and B
  sitting on a pipe

  ```

  The computer doesn't care what kind of linking and line feeds you use. It will still do the calculations and give you the result you want. Interpolation and multi-line strings are used to make it easier for developers to read code.

  Write the text below into the `text` variable. Use triple quotes.

  ```
  Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell...
  they're all just spokes on a wheel.
  This one's on top, then that one's on top, and on and on it spins,
  crushing those on the ground.
  ```
