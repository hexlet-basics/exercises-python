name: Functions With Varying Numbers of Parameters
theory: |

  In this lesson, we'll take a look at the `max()` function and see how it works in Python.

  Some functions are a little different in that they take a variable number of parameters. And we're not talking about default values. Check out this example:

  ```python
  max(1, 10, 3)  # 10
  ```

  In the above example, the `max()` function finds the maximum value among the passed parameters. To find out how many parameters can be passed to the input, you need to look at the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=pow#max) этой функции. Там мы увидим такую конструкцию:

  ```
  max(arg1, arg2, *args[, key])
  ```

  This means that `max()` takes two or more parameters as input:

  ```python
  max(1, -3, 2, 3, 2)  # 3
  ```

  If the function finds several parameters with the maximum value, then it'll return the very first one.

  Calculate the minimum number (not mentally) from 3, 10, 22, -3, 0 - and display it. Use the `min()` function, which works in the same way as `max()`.
