  In this lesson we will learn the rules for transforming an argument and how to work with compound expressions and double negation.

  ## Rules of Conversion

  Look at the example:

  ```python
  print(0 or 1)
  ```

  ```bash
  1
  ```

  The way the **ORI** operator works is that its execution from left to right is interrupted and the result of the first argument that can be converted to `True` is returned. If there is no such argument, the last one, the right one, is returned.

  Example with operator **AND**:

  ```python
  print(0 and 1)
  ```

  ```bash
  0
  ```

  The way the **AND** operator works is that its execution from left to right is interrupted and the result of the first argument, which can be converted to `False`, is returned. If there is no such argument, the last one - the right one - is returned.

  There are two conversion rules in Python:

  * `0`, `0.0`, ``'` and `None` are cast to `False`. These values are called **falsy**. This includes other data types that we will study in Hexslet
  * Everything else is reduced to `True`.

  These rules are used in development, for example, to define a default value:

  ```python
  value = name or ''
  # Examples
  234 or '' # 234
  'hexlet' or '' # 'hexlet'
  None or '' # ''
  ```

  If `name` takes one of the falsy values, the variable `value` will be assigned an empty string. In this case, in the following code we will be able to handle `value` as a string.

  But there is a potential bug here. If `name` contains a falsy value, and the variable `value` can be assigned values like `0`, `False`, `None`, the code above will not work correctly:

  ```python
  # The significance is actually there,
  # but it is Falsy, so it is not selected on the OR condition
  False or '' # ''
  0 or '' # ''
  None or '' # ''
  ```

  ## Compound expressions

  If you combine logical expressions with each other, you can get some pretty interesting ways of solving problems with code.

  Suppose we need to implement code in which a variable is written:

  * String `yes` if the number is even
  * String `no` if odd

  This can be done by using the knowledge gained above:

  ```python
  # even number
  result = 10 % 2 == 0 and 'yes' or 'no' # 'yes'
  # or print directly to the screen
  print(10 % 2 == 0 and 'yes' or 'no') # => 'yes'
  # odd number
  print(11 % 2 == 0 and 'yes' or 'no') # => 'no'
  ```

  These expressions work according to order and priority. The priority of assignment is the lowest, so it happens at the end. The priority of comparison `==` is higher than the priority of the logical operators `and` and `or`, so the comparison occurs earlier. Further the code is executed from left to right, because the priority of `and` is higher than the priority of `or`. Let's look at it step by step:

  ```python
  # For an even
  # 1 step
  10 % 2 == 0 # True
  # 2 step
  True and 'yes' # The result is true
  # The or check is done, but the right part is not executed, because it immediately returns 'yes'.

  # For an odd
  # 1 step
  11 % 2 == 0 # False
  # 2 step
  False and 'yes' # The result is false.
  # 3 step
  False or 'no' # Selects and returns 'no'
  ```

  The same scheme can be used with any expression at the beginning:

  ```python
  print(somefunc() and 'yes' or 'no')
  ```

  You can check yourself and experiment with the code in [Replit](https://replit.com/@hexlet/python-basics-logical-expressions).

  ## Double Negation

  Recall what the operation of negation looks like:

  ```python
  answer = True
  print(not answer)  # => False
  ```

  With double negation, the final value is equal to the initial value:

  ```python
  answer = True
  print(not not answer)  # => True
  ```

  The `not` operator always returns a Boolean value, regardless of the type of the passed argument, rather than replacing the value with the opposite. Therefore, a double negation will also return a boolean True/False.

  ```python
  answer = 'python'
  print(not answer) # => False
  print(not not answer) # => True
  ```

  ## Selection error

  Imagine that we need to check whether a value is equal to one or the other. For example, the variable `value` must contain one of two values: `first` or ``second`. Beginner developers sometimes write this expression this way:

  ```python
  value == ('first' or 'second')
  ```

  However, such a code will lead to the wrong result. It is necessary to remember the priority of operations. The first thing is to calculate everything specified in brackets - `'first' or ` second'`. If you execute this code in Replit, the output will be as follows:

  ```bash
  python
  Python 3.8.2 (default, Apr 12 2020, 15:53:37)
  >>> 'first' or 'second'
  'first'
  >>>
  ```

  Now replace the original expression with a partially calculated one:

  ```python
  value == 'first'
  ```

  Not at all what we expected. Now let's go back to the beginning and write the test correctly:

  ```python
  # It is not necessary to put parentheses,
  # because the priority == is higher than the priority of or
  value == 'first' or value == 'second'
  ```

instructions: |

  Implement a function `string_or_not()` that checks if the passed parameter is a string. If yes, it returns `'yes'` otherwise `'no'`.

  ```python
  string_or_not('Hexlet') # 'yes'
  string_or_not(10) # 'no'
  string_or_not('') # 'yes'
  string_or_not(False) # 'no'
  ```

  You can check if the passed parameter is a string with the function [isinstance()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#isinstance):

  ```python
  isinstance(3, str) # False
  isinstance('Hexlet', str) # True
  ```
