Learning a new programming language traditionally begins with 'Hello, world!'. It is a simple program that both displays a greeting on the screen, and introduces the new language, showing its syntax and its program structure.

```text
  Hello, World!
```

This tradition is over forty years old, so we're not thinking of breaking it any time soon. In the first lesson, we'll write a program called `Hello, world!`. To do this, you have to give the computer a special command. In Python, it's: `print()`.
