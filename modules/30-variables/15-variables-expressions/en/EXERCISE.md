Write a program that takes the original number of euros written in the variable `euros_count`, converts euros to dollars, and prints it to the screen. Then, it should convert the result to yuans and print it on a new line.

Example output for 100 euros:

```text
125.0
863.75
```

For the purposes of the exercise, we'll say that:
- 1 euro = $1.25
- 1 dollar = 6.91 yuans
