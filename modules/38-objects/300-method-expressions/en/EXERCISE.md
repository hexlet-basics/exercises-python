Find the characters *N* and *,* (comma) inside the text in the `text` variable. Print their indices on the screen. Expected output from the tests:

```text
Index Of N: 0
Index Of ,: 25
```

Your task is to find these indices in the string using the `.find()` method and put them in `print()` without using intermediate variables. If you want to split the output into two lines, you may need `\n`.
