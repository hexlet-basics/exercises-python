name: Class and Init Method
theory: |

    In Python, a class is a code template for creating objects. Objects have member variables and have behavior associated with them. In python, a class is created by the keyword class.

    The __init__ method in Python is a special method that gets called when a memory is allocated for a new object. This method initializes the new object. The __init__ method is called immediately after an object of a class is instantiated. The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object.

    Example:

        'class Person:
            def __init__(self, name):
                self.name = name

        p = Person("John")
        print(p.name)  # John'

        In the code above, the Person class has an __init__ method that takes self and name parameters. self is a special parameter that is always passed as the first argument and refers to the instance of the class. In the __init__ method, we assign the name parameter to self.name. After creating an object p of the Person class, we can then access the name attribute and print it.

Given a class Person with a name attribute and an age attribute. Write an __init__ method that accepts two parameters: 
    a name and an age, and assigns them to the respective attributes of the object. Remember, the self parameter is always passed first in any method of a class.
