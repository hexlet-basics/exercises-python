name: Classes and methods
description: |

  In Python, the data we use in our programs can be organized into classes. Classes form the basis of object-oriented programming in Python.

  Classes have attributes and methods. Attributes are variables associated with the class, and methods are functions associated with the class.

  A class is declared using the class keyword, followed by the class name and a colon. Inside the class, you can define attributes and methods.
